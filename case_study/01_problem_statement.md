# Problem Statement

**Scenario:** A small team tracks customer requests in spreadsheets. Items get lost, priorities are unclear, and status reporting takes too long.

**Goal:** Create a lightweight request tracker that supports:
- consistent intake fields
- basic prioritization
- clear status reporting

## Stakeholders
- Requesters (business users)
- Delivery team (engineers/analysts)
- Leadership (needs weekly status)

## Success metrics
- Reduce time to produce a weekly status report
- Reduce incomplete requests (missing owner/priority)
- Improve visibility of request aging
