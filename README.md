# BA Requirements -> UAT Case Study

This repo is a small business analysis case study showing how I go from a vague request to something that can be tested and delivered.

## What's inside
- Problem statement + stakeholders + success metrics
- As-Is / To-Be workflow (Mermaid)
- User stories + acceptance criteria
- Test plan + UAT test cases
- Sample data + SQL validation queries
- Release notes + "what I'd do next"

## Why I built it
A lot of BA work is documentation and decision-making, not just code. I wanted a repo that makes that work visible and easy to review.

## How to review quickly
If you're skimming, I'd recommend:
1) Read the problem statement + success metrics  
2) Look at the user stories + acceptance criteria  
3) Check the UAT test cases + SQL validation queries
